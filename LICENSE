IMPORTANT NOTE : beware that license of the content of this repository differs between 
source code (including documentation) and listing data.

 LISTING DATA (content of the "indexes" folder)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Listing data may only be reused in a way that complies
with the license of the listings (each entry in the "listings.json" is provided with its
associated license). Some of them (e.g. OpenSustain) are licensed under Creative Common,
which will require you to acknowledge the original source as well.

While this may be seen as impractical, this is a necessary step to ensure that due
credit is given to very work-intensive collection and curation of the listing datasets
(OpenSustain has for example required over 3000 hours of research and curation).
